<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a passionate English teacher who finds real joy in helping others learn to communicate.<br/>
   I work with a wide range of students, including those with visual impairments, and I always aim to create lessons that are fun, meaningful, and easy to follow.<br/>
   I believe language learning should be connected to everyday life, so I often use real conversations, idioms, and storytelling to keep things interesting and practical.<br/>
   Teaching is more than a job for me—it's a way to connect, inspire, and support growth in others.

<p>Outside the classroom, I'm a curious and creative soul. I love dancing, going for walks, taking care of myself, and diving into my studies. These activities help me stay balanced and energized.<br/>
   I'm always working toward my goals, especially my dream of building a peaceful and fulfilling life—hopefully in Germany, where I imagine better opportunities and a fresh start.<br/>
   I'm also learning German myself, step by step, because I believe in growing alongside my students.</p>

<p>What matters most to me is kindness, progress, and staying true to myself.<br/>
   Whether it's teaching, learning, or just living day by day, I try to bring love and purpose into whatever I do. I value deep connections, honest effort, and a bit of fun along the way.<br/>
   And of course, I always appreciate a sweet moment at the end of a good conversation</p>
